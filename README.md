# Immune War
## Overview
My thesis project is a game which combines tower defense game with first person shooter. It is about how immune cells fight with pathogens like bacterias and virus in human's body. I used Unity3D engine to build it. 
## Background
There was a very popular cartoon in 2018 called Cells at Work. It is the stories between the cells in a human body. All characters in this cartoon are personification. For example, the red blood cells are transport workers, they deliver oxygen to organs and send back carbon dioxide to lung. The white blood cells are soldiers, they are aggressive and strong, kill the invading enemies from outside world. The story of this cartoon is very attractive, and people could learn a lot of biology knowledge from it. I find I can make a very interesting combat game.
I considered focusing on immune system, because many biological characteristics in immune system could be used as fighting factors in a game. There are four main immune cells, B cell, T cell, Macrophage and Neutrophil. They have very distinctive features with each other. For B cell, it could "blow" the antibody into the fluid, so it can damage the pathogens further than other immune cells. For T cell, especially the killer T, it is the most destructive immune cell in human body, but it is only good at short distance attack. For Macrophage, it is the biggest immune cell, and it is omnivorous, almost eat anything, even the "garbage" inside the blood vessels. It can extend part of his body to surround the pathogen and digest them. However, for specific bacteria or virus, its attack force is not as good as B and T. And Neutrophil is the weakest immune cell among the other three, but the number of it is the most in the blood. However, when it attack pathogens, it will be died.
## My Characters
After knowing these background knowledge, I was inspired to make these four immune cells as my game's roles. 
### B Cell
B Cell can shoot antibody to the air. When the antibody to the air, it is like a Y character, which is the abstract feature of real antibody. When the antibody collide with pathogen, it will cause some damage to pathogen. The antibody stops and explodes only when it is hit with something.
### T Cell
It has a fork inside the body, when it meet an antibody, it will stab the fork into the enemy's body to cause a huge damage. In the real world in may looks like the picture, kind like full of forks on the surface of cell.
### Macrophage
Double size of B Cell and T Cell, it could also extend a part of his body like picture to catch the small pathogen. It just like a hook, to throw forward to catch a prey and pull back to get it. When it get the pathogen, it will eat it and help B fort to upgrade its ATK.
### Neutrophil
The smallest one among the four immune cells. Just a white ball in my game. You can put it all most everywhere as a suicide guard. You can put multiple neutrophils at same time. And it will pounce on them when they see the pathogens.
